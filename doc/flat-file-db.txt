key => value

http://foo/bar
key uses the notation: //foo/bar/ster terminated by "\n\t"
value immediatly following key terminated by "\n"

if value starts with '//', then its really a key in database

this also requires that keys be at least strlen('//') long so the compares to [0] and [1] don't have to be range checked.
