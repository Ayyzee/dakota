klass not class
__ prefix for language extensions
uses foo-bar (rather than foo_bar or fooBar)
is a precompiler (more than just a preprocessor)
uses "generic" functions for polymorphic dispatch (similiar to CLOS or Dylan)
is dynamically typed (vs statically typed)
is a hybred language
has a true first klass metaklass system modeled after ObjVLisp
object state is called "slots"
object behavior is called "methods"
normal objects do not expose their slots to consumers (not even subklasses)
box objects do expose their slots to all consumers
  - limitations
traits are a mechanism of reuse which is behavior only (no state)
  - limitations
interfaces are declaritive only (traits and klasses are definitive)
klasses/traits/interfaces compare and contrast
catalogs are a rough approximation of headers for a library
