CLOS

Dylan

complete klass/metaklass system (no mirror like in ST or OC)
** lose the distiction of instance vs klass variables/methods
dynamically typed
instantiation over construction
highly tunable (dispatch style, mono-morphic methods, ...)
single inheritence + traits + interfaces
** diamond inheritence is only a problem for 'state', not 'behavior'
** significant improvement for decomposition
ideal for callback oriented programming
(everythings an object vs everythings a function)
true keyword arguments avoids the n-factorial contructor problem
no fragel base class delimma
box() and unbox()
only a precompiler
natural to transition from ADTs to Dakota klasses
integrated with the features common to all dynamic libraries and dynamic loaders
