"These days I start from h = 5381, and set h = h << 5 + h + c mod any
power of 2 for each new character c. Apparently Chris Torek prefers a
multiplier of 31: h << 5 - h + c. These are reliable and extremely
fast. You can make them even faster if you want to hash an entire
string at once: just precompute powers of 31 or 33, etc."
