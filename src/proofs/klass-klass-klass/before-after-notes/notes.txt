Normally a user would not specify the metaklass using the klass
decl. If the user did, the extracted metaklass must be a subklass of
the user declared metaklass (the extracted metaklass must declare
itself to be a subklass of the user declared metaklass. And the name
of the extracted metaklass should be <klass-name>-<user-declared-klass>.

A metaklass must be an eventual subklass of klass (so the default
superklass for a metaklass is klass). A metaklass (or any klass for
that matter) must use klass or a subklass in its klass decl.
